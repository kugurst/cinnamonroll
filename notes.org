* Configuration Notes
  + See -config/application.rb- to add =PasswordHash.rb= to the list of files to load
  + See -config/environments/development.rb- to set the networks allowed to access the web console
  + See -app/controllers/application_controller.rb- to set files that will be reloaded when changed.
  + See -config/boot.rb- to change the =rails server= bind address.

* Practices
  + Place precompiled javascript files in -public/js-
    + Include these files by referencing ="/js/..."=

* Security
** Encryption Scheme
   + The client makes the RSA key.
   + The client sends a request.
     + If the client doesn't have an AES key, it sends a request to the server
   + The client decrypts the AES key using its private key, and then encrypts using the key and random IV.
   + Duplex communication is formed by server and client generating their own IV per communication.
