        %h3 Who I Am
      %p I enjoy working on complex systems; I Ô¨Ånd the challenge of breaking down an intricate system into smaller pieces and realizing the design intensely rewarding. Sometimes, I go the reverse, turning my once simple desktop into a mini-server, complete with RAID 5 and SSH, FTP, and HTTP access. When I am not programming or designing hardware, I may practice my cello or indulge my audiophilia.
